# Introductory-Data-Science-Tasks
Set of small projects I did while learning Data Science!

# Background Information
This is the repository I created while I was learning Data Science. This repository contains the small projects I took while learning Data Science. I have started the first small project with just knowledge of Python, Pandas and Matplotlib library. As I progressed, I have updated the repository with more such small projects.

As I have created these projects while I was in learning phase, these projects answer the basic data analysis questions. This project might contain some errors or warnings which was unable to resolve during the learning phase so please feel free to make any changes.

# For new learners
If you have started learning Data Science and wants to get some hands on small projects alongside what you learn then these projects could be a start for you. I have tried my best to add comments wherever possible to make the process easy for you to understand. I have further added readme files inside each project to get you idea about what I have done in the project
