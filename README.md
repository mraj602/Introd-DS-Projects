# Introductory-Data-Analysis-Tasks
Set of small projects I did while learning Data Science!

# Background Information
This is the repository I created while I was learning Data Analytics. This repository contains the small projects I took while learning Data Analytics. I have started the first small project with just knowledge of Python, Pandas and Matplotlib library. As I progressed, I updated the repository with more minor tasks.

As I created these projects while in a learning phase, these projects answer the basic data analysis questions. This project might contain some errors or warnings which was unable to resolve during the learning phase so please feel free to make any changes.

# For new learners
If you have started learning Data Science and want to get some hands on small projects alongside, these projects could be a start for you. I have tried my best to add comments wherever possible to make the process easy for you to understand. I have added readme files inside each project to give you an idea about what I have done in the project.
