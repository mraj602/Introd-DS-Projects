# Pandas, Matplotlib-Sales Data Analysis

This project focuses on answering simple questions that arise while looking at the sales data of any business. This was personally my first hands-on project. 
I did this while I was learning Data Science. This project was informative because it made me think about how a data analyst would think (at least a bit!) and how to start with projects.

# Languages and software used

I used only Python with Pandas and Matplotlib library on Jupyter Notebook. You can, of course, use any platform you want, but Jupyter Notebook helps in performing the tasks required more easily
 
 # The Data

I collected 12 different CSV files containing sales data for 12 additional months of an electronics store in many states USA. Of course, I found the data online, so you might get the same data at many places. The data has been placed in a different folder in the directory. Could you make sure to see those data before starting the project?
 
 # The Questions
 
 Using this project, I have tried to solve five questions arising after seeing the data. Those questions are:\
 1. Which month had the most and least sales of data?
 2. Which city had the highest and lowest sales of data?
 3. What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of purchases?
 4. What products are most often sold together?
 5. What product sold the most? Why do you think it did? 
 
 # The Project
 ### I had grouped the tasks I did under the following steps:\
 ## 1. Merging Data
 ## 2. Knowing and Cleaning the Data
 * Understanding the data we have
 * Dropping NaN values
 * Dropping garbage values
 * Creating new columns necessary for analysis
 * Dropping columns that are of no use
 * Converting columns to required data types
 ## 3. Answering Questions
 ### 1. Which month had the most and least sales of data?
 * Grouping data
 * Plotting data
 * Interpreting conclusions
 ### 2. Which city had the highest and lowest sales of data?
 * Grouping data
 * Plotting data
 * Interpreting conclusions
 ### 3. What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of purchases?
 * Grouping data
 * Plotting data
 * Interpreting conclusions
 ### 4. What products are most often sold together?
 * Checking duplicates
 * Grouping data to a new column
 * Dropping duplicate data
 * Converting repeated data in a column to list the number of occurrences
 * Plotting data
 * Interpreting conclusions
 ### 5. What product sold the most? Why do you think it did?
 * Grouping data
 * Plotting data
 * Interpreting conclusions
 * Proving the hypothesis of the conclusion
