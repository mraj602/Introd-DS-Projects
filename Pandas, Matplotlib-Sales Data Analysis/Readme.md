# Pandas, Matplotlib-Sales Data Analysis

This project focuses on answering simple questions that arises while looking at sales data of any business. This was personally my first hands-on project 
I did while I was learning Data Science. This project was one of the most informative project for me because it made me think how a data scientist would think (at least a bit!)
and how to actually start with projects.

# Languages and softwares used

I used only python with Pandas and Matplotlib library on Jupyter Notebook. You can ofcourse use any platform you want but Jupyter Notebook helps in performing the tasks required
 more easily
 
 # The Data

I had collected 12 different CSV files containing sales data for 12 different months of a electronics store situated in many states USA. Ofcourse I found the data online so you
 so you might get the same data at many places. The data has been placed in a different folder in the directory. Make sure to see those data before starting the project.
 
 # The Questions
 
 Using this project, I have tried to solve 5 questions arising after seeing the data. Those questions are:\
 1. Which month had the most and least sales of data?
 2. Which city had the highest and lowest sales of data?
 3. What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of purchases?
 4. What products are most often sold together?
 5. What product sold the most? Why do you think it did? 
 
 # The Project
 ### I had grouped the tasks I did under the following steps:\
 ## 1. Merging Data
 ## 2. Knowing and Cleaning the Data
 * Understanding the data we have
 * Dropping NaN values
 * Dropping garbage values
 * Creating new columns necessary for analysis
 * Dropping columns which are of no use
 * Converting columns to required data types
 ## 3. Answering Questions
 ### 1. Which month had the most and least sales of data?
 * Grouping data
 * Plotting data
 * Interpreting conclusions
 ### 2. Which city had the highest and lowest sales of data?
 * Grouping data
 * Plotting data
 * Interpreting conclusions
 ### 3. What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of purchases?
 * Grouping data
 * Plotting data
 * Interpreting conclusions
 ### 4. What products are most often sold together?
 * Checking duplicates
 * Grouping data to a new column
 * Dropping duplicate data
 * Converting repeated data in a column to list with number of occurences
 * Plotting data
 * Interpreting conclusions
 ### 5. What product sold the most? Why do you think it did?
 * Grouping data
 * Plotting data
 * Interpreting conclusions
 * Proving the hypothesis of conclusion
